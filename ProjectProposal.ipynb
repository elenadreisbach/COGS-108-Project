    "It is a known issue that veterans are at a higher risk of suicide in comparison to the general population, however the extreme degree to which this is true is certainly a lesser known fact. According to the U.S. department of Veteran Affairs, in comparison to the general population deployed veterans are at a 41% higher risk of suicide and non-deployed veterans are at a 61% higher risk. These abnormally high rates of suicide could be attributed to many factors that come with the high stress job of joining the military. Research has been done showing an inverse relation between suicide rates and socioeconomic status when analyzed at a community level, and we wonder how much this plays into the statistic for veterans (Rehkopf DH, Buka SL 2006).\n",

    "We hypothesize that lower socioeconomic status will increase suicide rates while better socioeconomic well-being will lower suicide rates among veterans. We believe that once veterans leave the military and lose structure in their life after being placed in high-stress situations they are put at higher risks of mental health issues related to suicide with lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This is important because this can help address where veterans suicide resources can best be utilized as well as identifying which groups need more support post-service. \n",

    "The data thus far has been relatively clean, only requiring minimal cleaning. The most important data set for us was that which detailed veteran suicides by state. As such, the rest of our data sets had to follow suit and were ultimately limited by the parameters of the first data set. For the Median Household Income dataset, it was necessary to decide between data which normalized the data to the current dollar or the 2016 dollar, and also remove columns which were unnecessary for our current use of the data (such as yearly standard error for the data). The Unemployment data was aggregated by county - as the analysis that we are doing is across states, it was necessary to group counties into their respective states. Similarly, the Housing Price Index data was organized by quarter - as our analysis is being conducted over a yearly time frame, we decided to organize this data into yearly categories. \n",

    "In regards to how we will analyze our data, we will be cross-referencing the Veteran Suicide Data with each of the other datasets in regards to year, including Housing Price Index, Median Household Income, Unemployment Rates, and Education Rates for each year that we have available data. This will help us to understand which factors are most closely linked to veteran suicide rates and which factors are not. Later on in our analysis we can start to postulate why we got these results. In addition, looking to see if the trend of correlation persists will help us determine if the correlation was legitimate or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we will be cross-referencing the Veteran Suicide Data with each of the other datasets in regards to state, including Housing Price Index, Median Household Income, Unemployment Rates, and Education Rates for each state that we have available data. Whereas the previous graphs gave us an indication of which factors could be most correlated to veteran suicide, these graphs will help determine if those factors are indeed indicative of suicide rates. Since our previous graphs only depend on 7 graphs, it may be that a few states caused the correlation to lean a certain way, and this might not have changed much in the span of the 6 years that we are studying. However, if we were to analyze if such correlation holds for all or most states based on the changes from year to year for that state, then we can confirm the relation between the given factor and suicide rates.\n",

    "The data we are accessing is publicly available for use, and we were unable to find any permission restrictions. However, as the data does concern veterans there is an increased necessity for protection of data which involves identifying information. We were lucky enough to find a dataset which had minimal identifying information (only involving state, year of death, and number of suicides within that state). One potential issue arises in states where there are few suicides within a given year - it would not be incredibly difficult to track down certain individuals within the armed forces who had committed suicide in a specific state during a specific year. The one potential ethical issue that we have discussed would be dealing with veterans data however our datasets do not include any protected information as they are representative of the overall population rather than specific people. If something of this sort were to arise, we could easily mitigate the issue by removing the sensitive information (such as names or zip codes). \n",
